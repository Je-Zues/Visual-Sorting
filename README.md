# C++ Visual Sorting Algorithms 

This project is to help visualize how different sorting algoritms operate. Using previous knowledge of sorting algorithms, I made 
a windows application to draw the numbers of an array. Using GDI+ and the WinAPI I was able to accomplish this. 



## SUPPORTED ALGORITHMS:
* Bubble Sort,
* Selection Sort,
* Insertion Sort,
* Radix Sort 

**Planning to add more Sorting Algorithms when I get the time**

## Features(Keeps Track):
* Time
* Swaps
* Compares 

**Designed to be customizable allowing to do 1 iteration per key press 
or sorting in real time**
